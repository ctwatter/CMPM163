  Area Light : like a rectangle being projected in a direction

I couldnt upload another image of something so i just made a reflective material that looks like a christmas ornament

I found two wooden textures, one had a more metalic look to it and added it to two objects in my scene.

I made a new skybox and adjusted the colors, as well as the size of the sun (which you cant see in this pic)
